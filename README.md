## User Story:

### Comprehensive Content Management with Version Control and Robust Infrastructure

*As a content manager, I want to have the ability to add, update, delete, and retrieve content with version control, so that I can manage content efficiently and ensure that changes are tracked and reversible.*

*Acceptance Criteria:*

1. Add Content: The system should allow users to create new content entries.
2. Update Content: The system should allow users to modify existing content entries.
3. Delete Content: The system should allow users to remove content entries.
4. Retrieve Content: The system should allow users to fetch and view content entries.
5. Version Control: The system should maintain a history of changes for each content entry, allowing users to revert to previous versions if needed.


*As a system administrator, I want to have a common logging structure, so that I can monitor and troubleshoot the system effectively.*

*Acceptance Criteria:*

1. Logging: The system should log all significant actions and events in a consistent format.
2. Error Tracking: The system should log errors with sufficient detail to facilitate troubleshooting.
3. Access Logs: The system should log user access and actions for security and auditing purposes.


*As a developer, I want to implement a common Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) structure for all services and content delivery, so that the system is secure and user actions are properly managed and tracked.*

*Acceptance Criteria:*

1. Authentication: The system should verify user identities before granting access.
2. Authorization: The system should control user permissions based on roles and policies.
3. Accounting: The system should track user actions and resource usage for auditing and billing purposes.


*As a database administrator, I want to have a database-agnostic implementation, so that the system can work with different database systems without requiring significant changes.*

*Acceptance Criteria:*

1. Database Abstraction: The system should use an abstraction layer to interact with different databases.
2. Compatibility: The system should support multiple database systems (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB) without requiring code changes.


*As a release manager, I want to manage the lifecycle and release of new versions of the headless CMS in existing deployments, so that updates can be rolled out smoothly without disrupting existing services.*

*Acceptance Criteria:*

1. Version Management: The system should support versioning of the CMS software.
2. Update Process: The system should provide a clear process for updating to new versions, including rollback options.
3. Compatibility Checks: The system should check for compatibility issues before applying updates.
